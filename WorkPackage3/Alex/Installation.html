<h1>Installation Manual for CTC office</h1>
<div>
  <h2>Running</h2>
  <p id="s1">The CTC comes with both the source files to build the ctc from scratch, as well as the compiled .class files nessessary to run it without compileing. To run the CTC without compileing, double click "run.bat". Keep in mind the CTC comes with a faux Track Controller module. To create a substitute track controller, see Compileing</p>
  <h2>Compiling</h2>
  <p id="s2">To substitue in a different Track Controller module, be sure that your track controller implements all the methods specified in the example Track Controller module located at /src/CTC/dummy/TrackController.java. Once you have your real track controller class, paste it over the example class and double click compile.bat, found in /src/CTC/compile.bat.</p>
  <h2>Modification of track</h2>
  <p id="s3">To modify the track file, open track.txt in your favorite text editor. Documentation on how the track is written is at the top. If, after changes and running the software you are getting an error within the range 101-199, see section 3.2.1 of the Users Manual</p>
  <p>For referance, these are they way track segments are formated.
