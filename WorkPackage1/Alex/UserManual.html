  <span id="s1"><h3>1 Three main views</h3><div>
    <p>The main window contains three panels: a top ribbon that stores functions related files, windows, and display; a left pane that gives you an overview of the rail, and a right pane that shows you detailed information and allows you to schedual and dispatch trains, and control switches.
    <span id="s1.1"><h4>1.1 Top ribbon</h4><div>
      <p>The top ribbon stores functions related to files, windows, and displays. From left to right, the drop down menues on the ribbon are:<br><code>File | Edit | Window | Help</code>

  <span id="s2"><h3> 2 Common functions</h3><div>
    <p>This sections describes breifly how to do some of the common functions of the CTC, without bothering with detail explaniations like in <a href="#s1">section 1</a>
    <span id="s2.1"><h4> 2.1 Show/hide train lines</h4>
      <p>All train lines are visible by default the first time the program starts. The names of each line can be seen the the <a href="#s1.3.2">Train line visibility pane</a> on the right hand side of the window (This pane can also be opened in a seperate window by selecting <code>Line Vis.</code> under the <code>Window</code> drop down at the top of the window). You can toggle the hidden state of a line by clicking the checkbox next to the line's name. It is not possible to set a line to half, quarter, or any other visibility than "on" and "off". Hideing a line will also hide any trains currently on the line.
    </span>
    <span id="s2.2"><h4> 2.2 viewing a train's information</h4>
      <p>To view a train's information, select it on the left hand side of the window, it's details will appear in the right hand side of the window, in the <a href="#s1.3.3">Train details pane</a>(This pane can also be opened in a seperate window by selecting <code>Details</code> under the <code>Window</code> drop down at the top of the window). This pane will show the train's name, the throughput of the section of track it is on, the number of passengers currently abord, the train's current speed, and the train's authority.
    </span>
    <span id="s2.3"><h4> 2.3 Manually dispatching a train</h4>
      <p>To manuall dispatch the train, use the <a href="#s1.3.4">Train Dispatch Pane</a> located on the right side of the window.(This pane can also be opened in a seperate window by selecting <code>Dispatch</code> under the <code>Window</code> drop down at the top of the window). To dispatch a train, select it in the left side of the window by clicking on it. You can varify it is selected by seeing if it's information is visible in the <a href="s1.3.3">Train Details Pane</a>. To dispatch, enter the station to dispatch it to, and press the <code>set</code> button at the bottom of the dispatch pane.
    </span>
    <span id="s2.4"><h4> 2.4 Schedualing trains</h4>
      <p>To schedual a train to be dispatched in the future, use the <a href="#s1.3.1">Train Schedual Pane</a>, located on the right hand side of the window.(This pane can also be opened in a seperate window by selecting <code>Schedual</code> under the <code>Window</code> drop down at the top of the window).

It's current schedual will appear in the train schedual pane, it there is nothing currently in the schedual, it will be blank. To add items to the schedual, click the <code>add</code> button at the bottom of the pane, a popup will apear, prompting your for the time of the new schudel item, and the station to dispatch the train to at that time. Once you have entered the time and station, press the <code>confirm</code> button. If you ever accidentally enter an incorrect schedual, you can change the schedual before it executes by selecting it in the table, and pressing the <code>edit</code> or <code>delete</code> buttons in the shedualing pane.
    </span>
    <span id="s2.5"><h4> 2.5 Moveing switches</h4>
      <p>To change the direction a switch is faceing, use the track switch pane, located on the right side of the window.(This pane can also be opened in a seperate window by selecting <code>Schedual</code> under the <code>Window</code> drop down at the top of the window).
