CTC should get track from the track model

Train model decides how many get off, track model decides how many get are trying to get on, train model takes most that fit on train
Communication limit is between track model and train model

Make sure all units are in miles/feet

Keep deltaT under 2000 millis so we don't lose track of trains!!!
